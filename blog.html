                <h2>Differences of Local storage vs Session storage?</h2>
                <p> The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin.
                    sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                    expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                    Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
                    and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h2>Global Scope vs Block Scope?</h2>
                <p>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
                    controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.</p>

                <h2>How does JS event loop works?</h2>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>variable that is not initialized will give undefined</li>

                        function with no return will give undefined
                    </li>
                    <li>accessing array elements outside of the index range will return undefined</li>
                    <li>set a value directly to undefined</li>
                    <li>property that does not exists of a object will return undefined</li>
                    <li>parameter that is not passed will give undefined</li>
                    <li>if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
